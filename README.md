# Custom_Commit Graph
This fun project allows you to generate commit graphs on GitHub in the shape of custom text (A-Z, space only). You can input any text, and the script will create a unique visual pattern in your GitHub contributions based on that text.

## How It Works

- Input Pattern: Input Pattern of words you want to write in font.py file
- Input your text: Enter any text you want to turn into a commit graph (A-Z, space only). For example, "HELLO" or "YOUR NAME".
- Commits: Each # character in the pattern represents a commit. The script will make multiple commits per day to create a darkened effect on the GitHub graph.
- GitHub Contributions: Once the commits are made, push them to GitHub to see your custom design show up in your contribution graph!

## Features

- Customizable text input.
- Multiple commits per day for a darker, more prominent effect.
- Easy-to-use Python script that works on both Windows and Linux.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Git installed on your machine.
- A GitHub account with a public repository.

## **Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to set up the project and generate your own commit graph.

#### 1. Clone the repository:
Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anonhossain/Custom_Graph.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to the folder:
```bash
cd Custom_graph
```

#### 3. Add Patterns:
Add Patterns of your text in font.py file. Take help from Google or AI to make the patterns

#### 4. Run the Script:
Execute the main.py script to start generating the commit graph. You will be prompted to enter the text you want to draw:
```bash
python main.py
```
**The script will:**

- Make the necessary commits (multiple commits per day for a darkened effect).
- Save the commit history to a file called file.txt

#### 5. Push the Commits to Github  
Execute the main.py script to start generating the commit graph. You will be prompted to enter the text you want to draw:
